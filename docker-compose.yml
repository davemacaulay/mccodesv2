# Note:
# If you encounter either mysqli not being found or captcha images not loading, chances are that the docker image was updated and those modules are no longer part of it
# A new image will be built for this so that the dependencies are there and ready for immediate development
# For now, log into the running container's shell - assuming default config, it'll be named something like "mccodesv2-php-web-1"
# Execute the following command:
# apt install libpng-dev -y && docker-php-ext-install mysqli gd
# Optionally, you can also install a couple of useful PHP packages
# docker-php-ext-install mbstring pdo pdo_mysql sockets sodium xsl

# After installation, the extensions should automatically be enabled (where applicable). If not, you can enable them manually.
# docker-php-ext-enable mysqli gd

# Note (cont.)
# Be sure to restart the Apache container to apply your changes!
